Music is so versatile and Spotify is a music platform that captures just that. Spotify is able to categorize different genres to fit every music taste. It is a platform that is used worldwide, which is why they have over 25 genres to listen to.Our flask api was able to unlock the newest hits for these genres, what countries listen to them, and view how popular they are.And...Welcome to our music galaxy!

- With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.
- Example:`sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET))`

## Introduction of Different Routes to get the JSON file data
